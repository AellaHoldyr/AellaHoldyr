### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Aella Holdyr. I'm interested in many things. Biology. Programming. Game Devolopment. Curiosity. Creativity.

I have worked as a beekeeper, a game developer, and even in the high frequency trading sphere. Many things are interesting and seeing concepts and ideas repeated across seemingly disparate fields is always fun.

I'm currently taking time off from work to learn and explore topics that interest me.


### Sharings
Here are some things I have written during this time. I hope you find them interesting and helpful.
